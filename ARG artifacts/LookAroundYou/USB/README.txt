Hello again, Ashton!

Isn't plain text wonderful?

Anyways, be careful what things you say "ありがとう" to, as you are only likely to get more of it. And... you've already guessed: this is indeed another puzzle game. =:)

Here's how this one works:
- Your birthday gift is hidden somewhere
- Everything you need to find your path to it is on this USB stick
- Good luck!

After last time, I have doubled my efforts to debug this game before it goes public (ie: to you). However, with no real play-testers to work with, I can't guarantee it's error-free so regular communication is encouraged. Also, we discovered Google won't always be your friend the way you want it to.

And once again, I couldn't have made this without the help of your friends. They did it for you, even if they didn't understand always what I was asking them to do.

Happy belated B-Day.
