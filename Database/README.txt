This is a database I made for myself to track leads on films that we might show when I was working for the film festival. It still contains some of my actual notes and pictures from a small selection of films, but no sensitive information. It wasn't uncommon for it to hold between 700-1000 film leads for a year so it was really beneficial for staying focussed on what contact work had been done, what needed to be followed up on, and what remained to do.

It lacks a graceful UI, but it was made primarily for an audience of me and to automate a lot of the repetitive contact and follow-up work.

I intended it to:
  - hold general and contact information for a movie
  - allow a variety of tags to find movies with specific parameters I might need (genres, countries, worth showing, who had seen it, etc)
  - hold a picture from the movie for reference
  - search for online details direct from the record in a browser
  - hold information about the state of a film lead's contact trail: how many times had we talked, when had we last talked, etc
  - generate emails that reflected both what information I was hoping to find out about a film (can I see it?, who has it?, can we screen it?) with enough personal touches to not make it feel like the form email it actually was
  - to go to online screener copies if they had been provided
  - sort leads by priority and activity
